# Direct Cuts - Screenshot Storyboard

## Overview

Screenshots are the most influential factor in app store conversion after the app icon. This storyboard defines a compelling visual narrative that converts browsers into downloaders.

**Strategy:** Benefit-first headlines with feature demonstrations. Each screenshot answers "What's in it for me?" before showing how.
