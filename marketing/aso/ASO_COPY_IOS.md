## Category Recommendations

### Primary Category: **Lifestyle**

**Justification:**
- Largest relevant category for personal services
- Where competitors (Booksy, StyleSeat) are listed
- Aligns with "convenience" and "personal care" positioning
- Strong discovery potential

### Secondary Category: **Health & Fitness**

**Justification:**
- "Grooming" falls under personal wellness
- Less competition than Lifestyle
- Captures users browsing health/wellness apps
- Aligns with self-care trends

### Alternative Consideration: **Shopping**
- Could work for marketplace positioning
- But less intuitive for service bookings
- Recommend Lifestyle as primary
